# punk-beer

To start the app, use script *npm start*

## Brief overview

This app is based on the API of <https://punkapi.com/>. Users are able to search for beers, although they are limited to the 25 beers, the API returns, initially.
Users, also have the ability to like beers, which for ease, are stored in the browser's local storage.

## What is currently implemented?

- Search functionality;

- "Like" functionality;

- Get a random beer from the API;

- Error page for "No Match" routes;

- Playing a sound when users click on the Card component;

- If Color Units Ebc < 40 a color box, representing the beer's color is displayed.

- Animation when user clicks the "Like" button

## Ideas for improvements

- Make the whole app responsive;

- Remove redundant files, imported by create-react-app;

- App Architecture

- Use SCSS instead

- Implement like buttons in "Favorites" page so the user can remove entities

-Implement a Loader component
